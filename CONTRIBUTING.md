## Contributing Code

Work on whatever you like.

If you're writing code, follow PEP8 as a style guideline. Make sure you run the tests before opening a PR, to save time.

```
python setup.py test
```

Write good commit messages. Try to keep the first line under 50 characters, and make it a good summary. Skip the next line, and
take as many other commit lines as you need to explain your changes. I prefer single-commit PRs, but if your change breaks
logically into a few separate commits, that's OK.

The build must pass on Travis before your PR will be merged. At least one approval is needed.

If you're just commenting on other PRs, try to leave constructive feedback. Don't be a jerk about it.

Feel free to open issues as well.
