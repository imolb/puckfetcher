0.7.5 (2016-04-06):
    * Provide a better command line interface.
        - This allows passing commands (load, list, etc.) to the program.
        - You can also run 'puckfetcher prompt' to get a prompt to enter commands into.
        - Use 'puckfetcher --help' to see the possible commands.
    * BREAKING CHANGE - Running 'puckfetcher' with no arguments will no longer work - you must
      provide a command.
    * Puckfetcher is quieter on the command line by default (still logs everything it's doing).
    * Fix some bugs in documentation.

0.7.4 (2016-03-22):
    * Make absolute path detection OS-independent
    * Use user's backlog_limit instead of ignoring it, fix logic around that.
