    * BUGFIXES
        * Fix a typo in text output spacing.

1.3.3 (2019-08-06):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Be more conservative about ID3 tag editing. Tested with a podcast recently that is .m4a
          files, and they broke on download because those files can't have ID3 tags.

1.3.2 (2019-03-16):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Pin current latest versions of dependencies.
        Some big jumps.
        * util.sanitize works on windows now,
        so let puckfetcher use it.

    * DEV
        * Use reST docstring format in subscriptions.py,
        will later go over the rest.
        * Fix some inconsistencies in formatting strings, comments, and logging.
        * Make _filter_nums require keyword args and default min_lim.
        * Make update require keyword args,
        and make it not change any property if the corresponding arg isn't provided.

1.3.1 (2018-05-22):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Pin current latest versions of dependencies.

    * DEV
        * Attempt again to generate docs properly with sphinx.

1.3.0 (2017-12-04):
    * FEATURES
        * Add reload_config command. Reload config file after editing without quitting.

1.2.6 (2017-11-30):

1.2.5 (2017-11-30):
    * BUGFIXES
        * If user doesn't supply "album" in metadata, use sub name (expected but etc.).

1.2.4 (2017-11-30):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Prefer user metatdata per-sub over cache metadata per-sub (expected but not actual
          behavior).

1.2.3 (2017-11-27):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Prefer user settings per-sub over cache settings per-sub (expected but not actual
          behavior).

1.2.1 (2017-11-27):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Fix string that should have been a format string in "add to queue" command.

1.2.1 (2017-11-27):
    * BUGFIXES
        * Write metadata (entry and sub) to cache.

1.2.0 (2017-11-27):
    * DEV
        * Pull ID3v2 tags into subscription metadata if there isn't already data there.
        * Pull tags into metatada on entries (and add that as a dict to the dict).

1.1.1-1.1.5 (2017-11-25 - 2017-11-26):
    * DEV
        * Several rebuilds to get builds to work again.
        * Include drewtilities util library to share some stuff between projects.

1.1.0 (2017-11-25):
    * FEATURES:
        * Fill in ID3v2 tags.
        * Set "set_tags = true" in global config to enable.
        * Please supply any/all of 'album', 'album_artist', and 'artist' in per-sub config.
        * If you have a subscription where you want to overwrite the MP3 filename with the RSS
        * title, set "overwrite_title" to true in the per-sub config.

    * DEV
        * Fix missed non-Python3.6 formatted strings instances.
        * Get rid of textwrap.
        * Update all dependencies to latest version, re-pin.

1.0.4 (2017-09-08):
    * BREAKING:
        * Only Python 3.6+ are supported now.

    * DEV:
        * Use Python3.6 formatted strings and variable annotations.

1.0.3 (2017-04-27):
    * DEV:
        * Pin to higher versions of all dependencies and set upper bounds.

1.0.2 (2016-12-15):
    * BUGFIXES:
        * Specify in documentation Python 3 is needed.
        * Fix off-by-one in list command.
        * Demote a bunch of log statements to Debug to be less noisy.
        * Space out podcast updating.
        * Report feed update being unneeded correctly, as a success instead of a failure.

    * OTHER:
        * Clean up feature list in README - no need to report very early stages any more.

1.0.1 (2016-11-12):
    * Fix data flag message on command line.

1.0.0 (2016-12-12):
    * BREAKING:
        * Cut Python 2.7, 3.3 support. This simplifies my code and lets me use neat new features.
        * Drop porting logic - puckfetcher will not upgrade smoothly to 1.0.0, you'll have to
          remove your cache file.
        * Remove update_forever command. It's silly and unnecessary.
        * Remove load command. All other commands run it automatically, there's no point in having
          an explicit load command.

    * NEW FEATURES:
        * Command to summarize entries downloaded in current session.
        * Command to summarize entries downloaded recently for a specific subscription.
        * Command to mock an entry as downloaded already.
        * Command to mock an entry as *not* downloaded already.
        * Command to add an entry to the download queue, to be added on next update.

    * BUGFIXES:
        * Create directories for subscriptions, if needed. Formerly, we'd crash.
        * Fix off-by-one error that could happen when enqueing subscriptions.
        * Fix naming of commands in --help option.
        * Rename "prompt" to "menu" in commands, because that's clearer.
        * Make sure README uses accurate commands.
        * Handle query params in podcast URLs properly - cut them out and don't save them to
          filenames.
        * Use UTF-8 consistently everywhere, to avoid encoding errors (formerly with a bunch of 2/3
          struct code - free with Python 3 and specifying encoding on file open/close).

    * DEV STUFF/CLEANUP:
        * Add static typing hints to the codebase. This adds a layer of bug-checking on builds.
        * Expand testing to be more thorough and include (some of) the new features.
        * Lower bar a bit for Code Climate, to have less issues.
        * A lot of shim code for Python 2/3 support, that got removed when I made this project
          3-only.
        * Added CONTRIBUTING.md - read if you want to contribute.
        * Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT for potential future contributors to read and follow.
        * Set up proper PRs with approvals. Use a bunch of Cool Phrases to approve PRs.
        * Clean up logging setup - never use print, always log. Info and above go to stdout.
        * Let errors inherit intelligently to cut duplicate code.
        * Make a code cleanup pass - did lots of stuff. Make pylint happy in more cases.
        * Specify when indexes are zero-based(code) and when they're one-based (UI) to (hopefully)
          prevent future off-by-one errors.

0.9.0 (2016-09-02):
    * Support PyPy, in theory.
    * Don't load cache multiple times.
    * Add some documentation - 1.0 will have more.
    * Fix last_modified, date storing.
    * Fix print formatting and log formatting.
    * Add new sub options:
        * Get details on sub.
        * Add to sub download queue.
        * Download full queue for sub.
    * Fix issues around cache loading/saving, and don't save unnecessary stuff in cache.
    * Fix off-by-one error around entry age - first of many.
    * NOTE: 0.9.0 has some logic to port earlier caches to this version. 1.0.0 will drop it.
    Please upgrade to 0.9.0 and then 1.0.0, or be happy with losing your cache and possibly having
    to re-download podcasts.

0.8.2 (2016-04-08):
    * Fix download URL in setup.py.

0.8.1 (2016-04-08):
    * Support download_backlog and backlog_limit as global defaults for all subscriptions.
        - 'download_backlog' defaults to 'true', 'backlog_limit' defaults to 1.
        - These can still be changed per-subscription.
    * Add use_title_as_filename option.
        - This uses the title of the RSS entry as the filename.
        - If this option is set to false, the filename from the RSS feed is used.
        - 'false' is the default value (this was the old behavior as well).
        - NOTE - currently disabled on Windows, because we can't guarantee the feed title will be a
          valid filename on Windows. Will come eventually.
    * Fixed some typos in log messages.
    * Updated example config to show off global defaults.

0.8.0 (2016-04-06):
    * Provide a better command line interface.
        - This allows passing commands (load, list, etc.) to the program.
        - You can also run 'puckfetcher prompt' to get a prompt to enter commands into.
        - Use 'puckfetcher --help' to see the possible commands.
    * BREAKING CHANGE - Running 'puckfetcher' with no arguments will no longer work - you must
      provide a command.
    * Puckfetcher is quieter on the command line by default (still logs everything it's doing).
    * Fix some bugs in documentation.

0.7.5 (2016-03-22):
    None, reupload because build seemed broken.

0.7.4 (2016-03-22):
    * Make absolute path detection OS-independent
    * Use user's backlog_limit instead of ignoring it, fix logic around that.
