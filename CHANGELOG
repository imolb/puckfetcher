0.9.0 (???):
    * pylint
    * Move some stuff to issues

0.8.2 (2016-04-08):
    * Fix download URL in setup.py.

0.8.1 (2016-04-08):
    * Support download_backlog and backlog_limit as global defaults for all subscriptions.
        - 'download_backlog' defaults to 'true', 'backlog_limit' defaults to 1.
        - These can still be changed per-subscription.
    * Add use_title_as_filename option.
        - This uses the title of the RSS entry as the filename.
        - If this option is set to false, the filename from the RSS feed is used.
        - 'false' is the default value (this was the old behavior as well).
        - NOTE - currently disabled on Windows, because we can't guarantee the feed title will be a
          valid filename on Windows. Will come eventually.
    * Fixed some typos in log messages.
    * Updated example config to show off global defaults.

0.8.0 (2016-04-06):
    * Provide a better command line interface.
        - This allows passing commands (load, list, etc.) to the program.
        - You can also run 'puckfetcher prompt' to get a prompt to enter commands into.
        - Use 'puckfetcher --help' to see the possible commands.
    * BREAKING CHANGE - Running 'puckfetcher' with no arguments will no longer work - you must
      provide a command.
    * Puckfetcher is quieter on the command line by default (still logs everything it's doing).
    * Fix some bugs in documentation.

0.7.5 (2016-03-22):
    None, reupload because build seemed broken.

0.7.4 (2016-03-22):
    * Make absolute path detection OS-independent
    * Use user's backlog_limit instead of ignoring it, fix logic around that.
