0.9.0 (2016-09-02):
    * Support PyPy, in theory.
    * Don't load cache multiple times.
    * Add some documentation - 1.0 will have more.
    * Fix last_modified, date storing.
    * Fix print formatting and log formatting.
    * Add new sub options:
        * Get details on sub.
        * Add to sub download queue.
        * Download full queue for sub.
    * Fix issues around cache loading/saving, and don't save unnecessary stuff in cache.
    * Fix off-by-one error around entry age - first of many.
    * NOTE: 0.9.0 has some logic to port earlier caches to this version. 1.0.0 will drop it.
    Please upgrade to 0.9.0 and then 1.0.0, or be happy with losing your cache and possibly having
    to re-download podcasts.

0.8.2 (2016-04-08):
    * Fix download URL in setup.py.

0.8.1 (2016-04-08):
    * Support download_backlog and backlog_limit as global defaults for all subscriptions.
        - 'download_backlog' defaults to 'true', 'backlog_limit' defaults to 1.
        - These can still be changed per-subscription.
    * Add use_title_as_filename option.
        - This uses the title of the RSS entry as the filename.
        - If this option is set to false, the filename from the RSS feed is used.
        - 'false' is the default value (this was the old behavior as well).
        - NOTE - currently disabled on Windows, because we can't guarantee the feed title will be a
          valid filename on Windows. Will come eventually.
    * Fixed some typos in log messages.
    * Updated example config to show off global defaults.

0.8.0 (2016-04-06):
    * Provide a better command line interface.
        - This allows passing commands (load, list, etc.) to the program.
        - You can also run 'puckfetcher prompt' to get a prompt to enter commands into.
        - Use 'puckfetcher --help' to see the possible commands.
    * BREAKING CHANGE - Running 'puckfetcher' with no arguments will no longer work - you must
      provide a command.
    * Puckfetcher is quieter on the command line by default (still logs everything it's doing).
    * Fix some bugs in documentation.

0.7.5 (2016-03-22):
    None, reupload because build seemed broken.

0.7.4 (2016-03-22):
    * Make absolute path detection OS-independent
    * Use user's backlog_limit instead of ignoring it, fix logic around that.
